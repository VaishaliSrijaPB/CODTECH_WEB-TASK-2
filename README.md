 ## OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT
 ### PROJECT NAME: TODO LIST WEB APPLICATION
 ## OBJECTIVE
 The objective of creating a to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is to provide users with a tool that helps them manage their tasks effectively. Here are the key objectives for such an application:

1. **Simplicity**: The app should have a clean and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to add, view, and manage their tasks.
2. **Accessibility**: It should be accessible from various devices, ensuring users can view and edit their to-do lists on-the-go.
3. **Interactivity**: Users should be able to interact with the to-do list by adding new tasks, marking tasks as complete, and removing tasks from the list.
4. **Persistence**: The app should save the state of the user's to-do list so that the information persists between sessions, typically using local storage or a backend database.
5. **Customization**: Users may be able to customize their to-do list by setting priorities, deadlines, or categorizing tasks.
6. **Notifications**: Optionally, the app can remind users of upcoming deadlines or unfinished tasks.
7. **Scalability**: The code should be structured in a way that new features, such as sharing lists or collaborating with others, can be easily added in the future.

By achieving these objectives, the to-do list app will serve as a practical tool for personal organization and productivity enhancement.
